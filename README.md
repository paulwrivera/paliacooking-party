# paliacooking-party

This is a redesign for the Palia fan site https://paliacooking.party built with Tailwind. <br><br>
The display should be managed with states rather than existing as separate files to ensure that users are receiving the correct visuals while using the web app. The separate files exist here only for a visual reference of how they should look in their final form. Either file can be used as the index file as they both contain the full source code of the project.
